EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ON IRIS DATASET

This project is part of my internship at CODECLAUSE 
The aim is to perform  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset using Python.

STEPS PERFORMED
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn
2. Displayed first rows, info, and statistics
3. Checked species distribution
4. Created pairplot visualization
5. Created correlation heatmap

RESULTS
  Dataset has 150 samples (50 for each species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
  Petal length and petal width are strongly correlated.
  Setosa is easily separable from the other two species.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
  Python
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
